# Modulog
This project turns a Raspberry Pi into an automatic USB audio recorder. The purpose of this is to be able to record music on a modular synthesizer without having to connect a computer and without having to interact with a DAW on the computer. The Raspberry Pi just sits there and records, and the musician can focus on the music. Later, the files recorded by the Raspberry Pi can be transferred to the computer and dropped into a DAW for further processing and mastering.
Of course this works for any instrument recorded with a USB audio interface, not just for a modular synthesizer.
